# World Template 

World Template is a Jekyll theme, with Tina.io CMS baked in. It's intended to be used for world building. It produces an easy to navigate website, but also produce a large well-formed html file that's intended to be used by large language models so you can ask questions of a chat bot and get answers. 

# Running 

## Docker

```bash 

```

# Deployment

We recommend using GitHub Actions, to build the static files then deploy them.
